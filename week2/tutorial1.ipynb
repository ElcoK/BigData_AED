    "In this tutorial you will learn how to read and explore census data from the [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) database. IPUMS USA collects, preserves and harmonizes U.S. census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation. Data includes decennial censuses from 1790 to 2010 and American Community Surveys (ACS) from 2000 to the present.\n",

    "IPUMS provides census and survey data from around the world integrated across time and space. IPUMS integration and documentation makes it easy to study change, conduct comparative research, merge information across data types, and analyze individuals within family and community context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to read the IPUMPS USA data, explore and manipulate it (to prepare for analysis) and how to perform a simple correlation and regression analysis. We will use the IPUMS USA database throughout the next four tutorials.\n",

Household variables have the same value for the entire household (e.g. energy costs) and individual variables differ within the household (e.g. age and gender). Individual variables are not very meaningful in predicting a household variable, such as energy costs. Think of a family with children, where a 3-year old daughter has the same energy costs as the 40-year old father. Therefore, it doesn't make sense to include AGE or SEX in the model in their current form. In this section, we will create new variables based on the variable AGE (We assume that SEX doesn't have a large effects on energy costs anyway). In the next steps, we are going to create a new variable (columns) which indicates the number of young children in a household. We hypothesize that young children will increase the household's energy bill (more dirty laundry, so increased usage of washing machine and dryer)."
