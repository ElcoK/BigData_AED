    "In this tutorial you will learn how to read and explore census data from the [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/) database. IPUMS USA collects, preserves and harmonizes U.S. census microdata and provides easy access to this data with enhanced documentation. Data includes decennial censuses from 1790 to 2010 and American Community Surveys (ACS) from 2000 to the present. \n",

    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to read the IPUMPS USA data, explore and manipulate it (to prepare for analysis) and how to perform a simple correlation and regression analysis. We will use the IPUMS USA database throughout the next four tutorials.\n",

To  make life a bit easier, download the dataset for the OLS regression in the following line of code (it includes the new variables you created and it deals with missing values). We use the package statsmodels to estimate the OLS regression. We could also use the sklearn library, but the statsmodels package has the advantage that it includes standard errors of the coefficient estimates. This means that we can say something about the significance of the explanantory variables and the causality between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable, something which is not possible with a machine learning model.
