On short timescales, the SPI is closely related to soil moisture, while at longer timescales, the SPI can be related to groundwater and reservoir storage. The SPI can be compared across regions with markedly different climates. It quantifies observed precipitation as a standardized departure from a selected probability distribution function that models raw precipitation data. The raw precipitation data are typically fitted to a gamma or Pearson Type III distribution, and then transformed to a normal distribution so the mean of SPI is zero. For this exercise, we will not fit the raw precipitation through a distribution to save time and also because we are working with historic data.\n","\n","We will now calculate SPI for all months throughout the year (m = 1:12).By normalizing the precipitation percentiles data afterwards drought conditions become comparable between different locations and for different months. The procedure will result in time series which values vary from ~ -3 (extremely dry) to ~ +3 (extremely wet compared to the long-term mean average conditions), providing information on meteorological drought conditions. The frequency, average duration, and severity of drought events are subsequently estimated by looking at the âclustered natureâ of individual drought months. \n","\n","Further information on SPI can be found [here](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-precipitation-index-spi).\n","\n","Take a careful look how we do this by inspecting the code-boxes and run the code in the code-boxes below to eventually plot the SPI values for all months.
