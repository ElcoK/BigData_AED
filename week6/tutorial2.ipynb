    "[**GeoPandas**](https://geopandas.org/) is a Python package that extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.\n",

    "[**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\n",

    "[**OSMnx**](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/) is a Python package that lets you download geospatial data from OpenStreetMap and model, project, visualize, and analyze real-world street networks and any other geospatial geometries. You can download and model walkable, drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code then easily analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with other infrastructure types, amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, and speed/travel time.\n",

The central component to the DBSCAN is the concept of **core samples**, which are samples that are in areas of *high density*. A cluster is therefore a set of **core samples**, each close to each other (measured by some distance measure) and a set of *non-core samples* that are close to a **core sample** (but are not themselves core samples). There are two parameters to the algorithm, `min_samples` and `eps`, which define formally what we mean when we say dense. Higher `min_samples` or `lower eps` indicate higher density necessary to form a cluster.\n",

    "More formally, we define a **core sample** as being a sample in the dataset such that there exist `min_samples` other samples within a distance of `eps`, which are defined as neighbors of the **core sample**. This tells us that the **core sample** is in a dense area of the vector space. A cluster is a set of **core samples** that can be built by recursively taking a **core sample**, finding all of its neighbors that are **core samples**, finding all of their neighbors that are **core samples**, and so on. A cluster also has a set of *non-core samples*, which are samples that are neighbors of a **core sample** in the cluster but are not themselves **core samples**. Intuitively, these samples are on the fringes of a cluster.\n",
