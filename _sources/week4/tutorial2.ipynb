You can download and model walkable, drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code then easily analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily download and work with other infrastructure types, amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, and speed/travel time.\n",

As we have seen during the lecture, and as you can also see by browsing on this website, there is an awful lot of climate data available through this Data Store. As such, it is very valuable to understand how to access and download this information to use within an analysis.
