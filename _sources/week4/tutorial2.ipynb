As we have seen during the lecture, and as you can also see by browsing on this website, there is an awful lot of climate data available through this Data Store. As such, it is very valuable to understand how to access and download this information to use within an analysis. To keep things simple, we only download one dataset today: [A winter windstorm](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-european-wind-storm-indicators?tab=overview).\n","\n","We will do so using an **API**, which is the acronym for application programming interface. It is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations. APIs are all around us. Every time you use a rideshare app, send a mobile payment, or change the thermostat temperature from your phone, youâ€™re using an API.\n","\n","However, before we can access this **API**, we need to take a few steps which can be found on the [CDSAPI setup webpage of the Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds-beta.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api/).

(2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420914000466), we will apply a sigmoidal vulnerability function satisfying two constraints: (i) a minimum threshold for the occurrence of damage with an upper bound of 100% direct damage; (ii) a high power-law function for the slope, describing an increase in damage with increasing wind speeds. Due to the limited amount of vulnerability curves available for windstorm damage, we will use the damage curve that represents low-rise *reinforced masonry* buildings for all land-use classes that may contain buildings. Obviously, this is a large oversimplification of the real world, but this should be sufficient for this exercise. When doing a proper stand-alone windstorm risk assessment, one should take more effort in collecting the right vulnerability curves for different building types.
