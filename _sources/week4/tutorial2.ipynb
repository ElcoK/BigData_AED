    "The windstorm data will be downloaded from the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/). As we have seen during the lecture, and as you can also see by browsing on this website, there is an awful lot of climate data available through this Data Store. As such, it is very valuable to understand how to access and download this information to use within an analysis. To keep things simple, we only download one dataset today: [A winter windstorm](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-european-wind-storm-indicators?tab=overview). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will do so using an **API**, which is the acronym for application programming interface. It is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations. APIs are all around us. Every time you use a rideshare app, send a mobile payment, or change the thermostat temperature from your phone, you’re using an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, before we can access this **API**, we need to take a few steps. Most importantly, we need to register ourselves on the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) portal. To do so, we need to register, as explained in the video clip below:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, the next step is to access the API. You can now login on the website of the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/). After you login, you can click on your name in the top right corner of the webpage (next to the login button). On the personal page that has just opened, you will find your user ID (**uid**) and your personal **API**. You need to add those in the cell below to be able to download the windstorm.\n",

    "To calculate the potential damage to both windstorms and floods, we use stage-damage curves, which relate the intensity of the hazard to the fraction of maximum damage that can be sustained by a certain land use. As you can see on the Corine Land Cover map that we just plotted, there are a lot of land use classes (44), though not all will suffer damage from either the windstorm or the flood event. For each of the land-use classes a curve and a maximum damage number are assigned.\n",

The DamageScanner was originally developed for the 'Netherlands Later' project [(Klijn et al., 2007)](https://www.rivm.nl/bibliotheek/digitaaldepot/WL_rapport_Overstromingsrisicos_Nederland.pdf).  The original land-use classes were based on the Land-Use Scanner in order to evaluate the effect of future land-use change on flood damages. We have tailored the input of the DamageScanner to make sure it can estimate the damages using Corine Land Cover.\n",

    "To estimate the potential damage of our windstorm, we use the vulnerability curves developed by [Yamin et al. (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420914000466). Following [Yamin et al. (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420914000466), we will apply a sigmoidal vulnerability function satisfying two constraints: (i) a minimum threshold for the occurrence of damage with an upper bound of 100% direct damage; (ii) a high power-law function for the slope, describing an increase in damage with increasing wind speeds. Due to the limited amount of vulnerability curves available for windstorm damage, we will use the damage curve that represents low-rise *reinforced masonry* buildings for all land-use classes that may contain buildings. Obviously, this is a large oversimplification of the real world, but this should be sufficient for this exercise. When doing a proper stand-alone windstorm risk assessment, one should take more effort in collecting the right vulnerability curves for different building types.  "
