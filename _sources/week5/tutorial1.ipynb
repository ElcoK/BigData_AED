In particular, we will focus on supervised classification. Supervised classification refers to the process of using a training dataset with known labels to guide a mathematical classifier in the task of labeling spectral space. They key characteristic is that the training dataset guides (or “supervises”) the labeling.\n","\n","The `Classifier` package within the **Google Earth Engine** handles supervised classification by traditional ML algorithms running in Earth Engine. These classifiers include CART, RandomForest, NaiveBayes and SVM. The general workflow for classification is:\n","\n","    1. Collect training data.

Set its parameters if necessary.\n","    3. Train the classifier using the training data.\n","    4. Classify an image or feature collection.\n","    5.

The `sample()` method generated two random samples from the input data: one for training and one for validation. The training sample is used to train the classifier. You can get resubstitution accuracy on the training data from `classifier.confusionMatrix()`. To get validation accuracy, we classify the validation data. This adds a `classification` property to the validation `FeatureCollection`. We will call `errorMatrix()` on the classified `FeatureCollection` to get a confusion matrix representing validation (expected) accuracy. Don't worry if things are bit unclear, we will do this step-by-step."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LpBDrhs60B_k"},"source":["### Random Forests\n","---\n","Let's first use Random Forests to classify our satellite image.
