    "## Supervised learning\n",
    "Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining—classification and regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification** uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression** is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business. Linear regression, logistical regression, and polynomial regression are popular regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised learning algorithms\n",
    "Various algorithms and computation techniques are used in supervised machine learning processes. We already discussed **Random Forests** and **Neural Networks** in detail during the lectures. Below you can find an overview of some of the other algorithms that you can apply within our tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive Bayes**\n",
    "Naive Bayes is classification approach that adopts the principle of class conditional independence from the Bayes Theorem. This means that the presence of one feature does not impact the presence of another in the probability of a given outcome, and each predictor has an equal effect on that result. There are three types of Naïve Bayes classifiers: Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Bernoulli Naïve Bayes, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. This technique is primarily used in text classification, spam identification, and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support vector machine (SVM)**\n",
    "A support vector machine is a popular supervised learning model developed by Vladimir Vapnik, used for both data classification and regression. That said, it is typically leveraged for classification problems, constructing a hyperplane where the distance between two classes of data points is at its maximum. This hyperplane is known as the decision boundary, separating the classes of data points (e.g., oranges vs. apples) on either side of the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-nearest neighbor**\n",
    "K-nearest neighbor, also known as the KNN algorithm, is a non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on their proximity and association to other available data. This algorithm assumes that similar data points can be found near each other. As a result, it seeks to calculate the distance between data points, usually through Euclidean distance, and then it assigns a category based on the most frequent category or average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its ease of use and low calculation time make it a preferred algorithm by data scientists, but as the test dataset grows, the processing time lengthens, making it less appealing for classification tasks. KNN is typically used for recommendation engines and image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised learning\n",
    "Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled data sets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are “unsupervised”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, association and dimensionality reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering** is a data mining technique for grouping unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences. For example, K-means clustering algorithms assign similar data points into groups, where the K value represents the size of the grouping and granularity. This technique is helpful for market segmentation, image compression, etc.\n",
    "- **Association** is another type of unsupervised learning method that uses different rules to find relationships between variables in a given dataset. These methods are frequently used for market basket analysis and recommendation engines, along the lines of “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought” recommendations.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality** reduction is a learning technique used when the number of features  (or dimensions) in a given dataset is too high. It reduces the number of data inputs to a manageable size while also preserving the data integrity. Often, this technique is used in the preprocessing data stage, such as when autoencoders remove noise from visual data to improve picture quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The main differences between supervised and unsupervised learning: Labeled data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather conditions and so on. But first, you’ll have to train it to know that rainy weather extends the driving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabeled data. Note that they still require some human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce and sippy cups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals**: In supervised learning, the goal is to predict outcomes for new data. You know up front the type of results to expect. With an unsupervised learning algorithm, the goal is to get insights from large volumes of new data. The machine learning itself determines what is different or interesting from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications**: Supervised learning models are ideal for spam detection, sentiment analysis, weather forecasting and pricing predictions, among other things. In contrast, unsupervised learning is a great fit for anomaly detection, recommendation engines, customer personas and medical imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complexity**: Supervised learning is a simple method for machine learning, typically calculated through the use of programs like R or Python. In unsupervised learning, you need powerful tools for working with large amounts of unclassified data. Unsupervised learning models are computationally complex because they need a large training set to produce intended outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Drawbacks**: Supervised learning models can be time-consuming to train, and the labels for input and output variables require expertise. Meanwhile, unsupervised learning methods can have wildly inaccurate results unless you have human intervention to validate the output variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Google Earth Engine\n",
    "Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis that brings Google's computational capabilities to bear on a variety of high-impact societal issues including deforestation, drought, disaster, disease, food security, water management, climate monitoring and environmental protection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Earth Engine consists of a multi-petabyte analysis-ready data catalog co-located with a high-performance, intrinsically parallel computation service. It is accessed and controlled through an Internet-accessible application programming interface (API) and an associated web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that enables rapid prototyping and visualization of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data catalog houses a large repository of publicly available geospatial datasets, including observations from a variety of satellite and aerial imaging systems in both optical and non-optical wavelengths, environmental variables, weather and climate forecasts and hindcasts, land cover, topographic and socio-economic datasets. All of this data is preprocessed to a ready-to-use but information-preserving form that allows efficient access and removes many barriers associated with data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can access and analyze data from the public catalog as well as their own private data using a library of operators provided by the Earth Engine API. These operators are implemented in a large parallel processing system that automatically subdivides and distributes computations, providing high-throughput analysis capabilities. Users access the API either through a thin client library or through a web-based interactive development environment built on top of that client library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to gain access to the Google Earth Engine\n",
