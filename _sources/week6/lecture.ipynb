    "## Natural Language Processing\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and humans in natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to help computers understand language as well as we do. It is the driving force behind things like virtual assistants, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, automatic text summarization, machine translation and much more. In this post, we’ll cover the basics of natural language processing, dive into some of its techniques and also learn how NLP has benefited from recent advances in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Natural Language processing difficult?\n",
    "Human language is special for several reasons. It is specifically constructed to convey the speaker/writer's meaning. It is a complex system, although little children can learn it pretty quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another remarkable thing about human language is that it is all about symbols. According to Chris Manning, a machine learning professor at Stanford, it is a discrete, symbolic, categorical signaling system. This means we can convey the same meaning in different ways (i.e., speech, gesture, signs, etc.) The encoding by the human brain is a continuous pattern of activation by which the symbols are transmitted via continuous signals of sound and vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding human language is considered a difficult task due to its complexity. For example, there are an infinite number of different ways to arrange words in a sentence. Also, words can have several meanings and contextual information is necessary to correctly interpret sentences. Every language is more or less unique and ambiguous. Just take a look at the following newspaper headline “The Pope’s baby steps on gays.” This sentence clearly has two very different interpretations, which is a pretty good example of the challenges in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Definitions within NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization** is, generally, an early step in the NLP process, a step which splits longer strings of text into smaller pieces, or tokens. Larger chunks of text can be tokenized into sentences, sentences can be tokenized into words, etc. Further processing is generally performed after a piece of text has been appropriately tokenized.\n",
    "- **Normalization** generally refers to a series of related tasks meant to put all text on a level playing field: converting all text to the same case (upper or lower), removing punctuation, expanding contractions, converting numbers to their word equivalents, and so on. Normalization puts all words on equal footing, and allows processing to proceed uniformly.\n",
    "- **Stemming** is the process of eliminating affixes (suffixed, prefixes, infixes, circumfixes) from a word in order to obtain a word stem.\n",
    "- **Lemmatization** is related to stemming, differing in that lemmatization is able to capture canonical forms based on a word's lemma. For example, stemming the word \"better\" would fail to return its citation form (another word for lemma); however, lemmatization would result in changing *better* into *good*.\n",
    "- **Corpus** (literally Latin for body) refers to a collection of texts. Such collections may be formed of a single language of texts, or can span multiple languages.\n",
    "- **Stop words** are those words which are filtered out before further processing of text, since these words contribute little to overall meaning, given that they are generally the most common words in a language. For instance, \"the,\" \"and,\" and \"a,\" while all required words in a particular passage, don't generally contribute greatly to one's understanding of content.\n",
    "- **Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging** consists of assigning a category tag to the tokenized parts of a sentence. The most popular POS tagging would be identifying words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.\n",
    "- **Statistical Language Modeling** is the process of building a statistical language model which is meant to provide an estimate of a natural language. For a sequence of input words, the model would assign a probability to the entire sequence, which contributes to the estimated likelihood of various possible sequences. \n",
    "- **Bag of words** is a particular representation model used to simplify the contents of a selection of text. The bag of words model omits grammar and word order, but is interested in the number of occurrences of words within the text. \n",
    "- **n-grams** means a sequence of n-words. It is another representation model for simplifying text selection contents. As opposed to the orderless representation of bag of words, n-grams modeling is interested in preserving  sequences of N items from the text selection.\n",
    "- **Regular expressions** is a string of text that lets you create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntactic and Semantic Analysis\n",
    "Syntactic analysis (syntax) and semantic analysis (semantic) are the two primary techniques that lead to the understanding of natural language. Language is a set of valid sentences, but what makes a sentence valid? Syntax and semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax is the grammatical structure of the text, whereas semantics is the meaning being conveyed. A sentence that is syntactically correct, however, is not always semantically correct. For example, “cows flow supremely” is grammatically valid (subject — verb — adverb) but it doesn’t make any sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntactic analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactic analysis, also referred to as syntax analysis or parsing, is the process of analyzing natural language with the rules of a formal grammar. Grammatical rules are applied to categories and groups of words, not individual words. Syntactic analysis basically assigns a semantic structure to text.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a sentence includes a subject and a predicate where the subject is a noun phrase and the predicate is a verb phrase. Take a look at the following sentence: “The dog (noun phrase) went away (verb phrase).” Note how we can combine every noun phrase with a verb phrase. Again, it’s important to reiterate that a sentence can be syntactically correct but not make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Semantic Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we understand what someone has said is an unconscious process relying on our intuition and knowledge about language itself. In other words, the way we understand language is heavily based on meaning and context. Computers need a different approach, however. The word “semantic” is a linguistic term and means “related to meaning or logic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic analysis is the process of understanding the meaning and interpretation of words, signs and sentence structure. This lets computers partly understand natural language the way humans do. I say this partly because semantic analysis is one of the toughest parts of natural language processing and it’s not fully solved yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speech recognition, for example, has gotten very good and works almost flawlessly, but we still lack this kind of proficiency in natural language understanding. Your phone basically understands what you have said, but often can’t do anything with it because it doesn’t understand the meaning behind it. Also, some of the technologies out there only make you think they understand the meaning of a text. An approach based on keywords or statistics or even pure machine learning may be using a matching or frequency technique for clues as to what the text is “about.” But, because they don’t understand the deeper relationships within the text, these methods are limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural Language Processing Techniques for Understanding Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at some of the most popular techniques used in natural language processing. Note how some of them are closely intertwined and only serve as subtasks for solving larger problems.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "#### **PARSING**\n",
    "\n",
    "What is parsing? According to the dictionary, to parse is to “resolve a sentence into its component parts and describe their syntactic roles.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That actually nailed it but it could be a little more comprehensive. Parsing refers to the formal analysis of a sentence by a computer into its constituents, which results in a parse tree showing their syntactic relation to one another in visual form, which can be used for further processing and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a parse tree for the sentence “The thief robbed the apartment.” Included is a description of the three different information types conveyed by the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/styles/ckeditor_optimize/public/inline-images/national/speech-nlp.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The letters directly above the single words show the parts of speech for each word (noun, verb and determiner). One level higher is some hierarchical grouping of words into phrases. For example, “the thief” is a noun phrase, “robbed the apartment” is a verb phrase and when put together the two phrases form a sentence, which is marked one level higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is actually meant by a noun or verb phrase? Noun phrases are one or more words that contain a noun and maybe some descriptors, verbs or adverbs. The idea is to group nouns with words that are in relation to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A parse tree also provides us with information about the grammatical relationships of the words due to the structure of their representation. For example, we can see in the structure that “the thief” is the subject of “robbed.”\n",
    "\n",
    "With structure I mean that we have the verb (“robbed”), which is marked with a “V” above it and a “VP” above that, which is linked with a “S” to the subject (\"the thief”), which has a “NP” above it. This is like a template for a subject-verb relationship and there are many others for other types of relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **STEMMING**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is a technique that comes from morphology and information retrieval which is used in natural language processing for pre-processing and efficiency purposes. It’s defined by the dictionary as to “originate in or be caused by.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, stemming is the process of reducing words to their word stem. A “stem” is the part of a word that remains after the removal of all affixes. For example, the stem for the word “touched” is “touch.” \"Touch\" is also the stem of “touching,” and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be asking yourself, why do we even need the stem? Well, the stem is needed because we’re going to encounter different variations of words that actually have the same stem and the same meaning. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*I was taking a ride in the car.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*I was riding in the car.*\n",
    "\n",
    "These two sentences mean the exact same thing and the use of the word is identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine all the English words in the vocabulary with all their different fixations at the end of them. To store them all would require a huge database containing many words that actually have the same meaning. This is solved by focusing only on a word’s stem. Popular algorithms for stemming include the Porter stemming algorithm from 1979, which still works well.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "#### **TEXT SEGMENTATION** \n",
    "\n",
    "Text segmentation in natural language processing is the process of transforming text into meaningful units like words, sentences, different topics, the underlying intent and more. Mostly, the text is segmented into its component words, which can be a difficult task, depending on the language. This is again due to the complexity of human language. For example, it works relatively well in English to separate words by spaces, except for words like “icebox” that belong together but are separated by a space. The problem is that people sometimes also write it as “ice-box.”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Named Entity Recognition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entity recognition (NER) concentrates on determining which items in a text (i.e. the “named entities”) can be located and classified into predefined categories. These categories can range from the names of persons, organizations and locations to monetary values and percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before NER: *Martin bought 300 shares of SAP in 2016.*\n",
    "\n",
    "After NER: Martin **{Person}** bought 300 shares of SAP **{Organization}** in 2016 **{Time}**.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "**Relationship Extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship extraction takes the named entities of NER and tries to identify the semantic relationships between them. This could mean, for example, finding out who is married to whom, that a person works for a specific company and so on. This problem can also be transformed into a classification problem and a machine learning model can be trained for every relationship type.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "With sentiment analysis we want to determine the attitude (i.e. the sentiment) of a speaker or writer with respect to a document, interaction or event. Therefore it is a natural language processing problem where text needs to be understood in order to predict the underlying intent. The sentiment is mostly categorized into positive, negative and neutral categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the use of sentiment analysis, for example, we may want to predict a customer’s opinion and attitude about a product based on a review they wrote. Sentiment analysis is widely applied to reviews, surveys, documents and much more.\n",
    "\n",
