# Big Data for Sustainability Sciences

Data is everywhere around us. But how can we make use of all this data to answer questions in sustainability sciences? How can twitter data help us to understand where and how severe people are affected by floods? Or how can we use earth observation data to classify land use? 

In the course Big Data in Sustainability Sciences, you will learn the tools and knowledge to work with large datasets that are widely used within sustainability sciences. This ranges from filling gaps in census data through machine learning approaches, to working with earth observation data to map wildfires.
