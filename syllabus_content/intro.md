# Course introduction

Data is everywhere around us. But how can we make use of all this data to answer questions in sustainability sciences? How can twitter data help us to understand where and how severe people are affected by floods? Or how can we use earth observation data to classify land use? 

In the course Big Data in Sustainability Sciences, students will learn the tools and knowledge to work with large datasets that are widely used within sustainability sciences. This ranges from machine-learning approaches to identify objects on satellite images, to working with international supply-chain data to understand global patterns in food, energy and material use. 

The course is structured around six main data types and related methods. Specifically, we will:
(i) explore census data and use machine-learning methods to fill data gaps in data-scarce environments;
(ii) recognize objects on satellite imagery through deep-learning methods;
(iii) better understand how wildfires affect us using remote sensing data;
(iv) re-structure and analyze global shipping data to understand patterns in global trade;
(v) apply visualization methods to understand patterns in global supply chain data
(iv) apply machine-learning techniques to identify the occurrence of droughts through social media data
